witchfinder
===========

A modified version of the infamous quad witchhut finder to fit my own needs. Instead of bundling the minecraft terrain generation this uses reflection on the jar for the generation. This surprisingly doesn't make it much slower, but most importantly it'll probably work with any future release of minecraft.

There is no license on this as most of the code isn't mine, full credit goes to TheCodeRaider, bbinme and the rest of the guys that got involved with the development of this (mostly the zipkrowd guys).
